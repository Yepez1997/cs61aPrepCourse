##Chapter 6 More About Methods
##So far we have used methods such as gets, puts, etc.
##Objects to nouns as to Methods to Verbs
##10 Methods learned insofar:
  ## puts, gets, chomp
  ## .to_i .to_f .to_s
  ## + - * /
##Click.tick example -> Click = object, .tick -> method
  ##Every verb needs a noun  = every method needs an object
  ##Does not always have to have a dot !
puts('hello ' .+ 'world') ## .+ is == +
puts((10.*9).+9) ## .* is == *
##Works: 'pig'.*5
##!Works: 5.*'pig'
puts self ##Prints out the object you are in (main)
##RECAP: EVERY METHOD HAS AN OBJECT
